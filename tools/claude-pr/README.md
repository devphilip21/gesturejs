## Troubleshooting

### Multiple GitHub Accounts

If you're using SSH aliases (e.g., `github.com-me` in `~/.ssh/config`) for multiple GitHub accounts, note that `gh` CLI doesn't recognize SSH config aliases.

Check your current auth status:

```sh
gh auth status
```

Switch to the correct account:

```sh
gh auth switch -u <username>
```

**Why this happens:**

- **SSH remote** (`git@github.com-me:...`): Uses `~/.ssh/config` aliases for git push/pull
- **gh CLI**: Calls GitHub API directly via `github.com`, independent of SSH config

These are managed separately - SSH via `~/.ssh/config`, gh CLI via `gh auth`.
